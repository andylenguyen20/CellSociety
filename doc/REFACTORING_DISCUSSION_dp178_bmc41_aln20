# Refactoring Discussion

Duplication Refactoring

* We did not have a lot of duplication to fix. We had 7 cases of duplication but none of them spanned more than three lines. 
    Some of the duplication was code added in for testing / debugging. 
    
Checklist Refactoring

* In terms of flexibility, we mainly had issues with using ArrayList instead of List, which we fixed. Additionally, there were a lot of magic numbers in the front-end
  code because we were playing around with coordinates on the screen . However, we fixed those issues through constants.
  
General Refactoring

* The refactoring tool told us to change things like ArrayList<String> to ArrayList<>() but we decided to keep them in for communication and clarity.
* We made the MenuCreator class static so that it can be called upon without using an object.
* We have not updated the XMLParser class because there are big changes to be made.
